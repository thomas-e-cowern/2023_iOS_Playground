# ``Fluent``

Fluent makes it easy for you to use FluentKit in your Vapor application. It ties together the FluentKit database abstraction layer with the Vapor application lifecycle. It also provides helpers for mapping FluentKit's models to Vapor's authentication APIs.

For more information, see the [Vapor documentation](https://docs.vapor.codes/fluent/overview/).
